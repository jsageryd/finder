Finder fix
===================

This makes Finder in OS X display the full path to the current directory in the title bar.


Usage
------------------

Run `fixfinder.bash` to apply. Run `restorefinder.bash` to restore to default settings.


Disclaimer
------------------

I take no responsibility for these scripts should they cause any harm.
